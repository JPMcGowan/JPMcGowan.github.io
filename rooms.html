<h3>Venus Suite</h3>
	<p> The Venus Suite is one of our most interesting rooms we have here at the Space Hotel. As you enter the room time slows down durastically. As one day on Venus is longer than a year on Earth! The heat will also be turned up in this room becuase of Venus being the hottest planet in our solar System. It comes with a King sized bed with a full bathroom and kitchen. A built in sauna is also available to residents of this room.

<h3>Neptune Room</h3>
	<p> The Neptune Room at The Space Hotel is one of our personal favorites. You are greeted with a dark blue themed room filled with cool decorations. We have an active observatory of the current climate on Neptune. Neptune has a very active climate, with some storms lasting about five years. The room is filled with hydrogen, helium and methane, all found in Neptune's  atmosphere. It comes with its own movie room and viweing deck. Watching movies surrounded by the lovely blue of Neptune really is an experience.
